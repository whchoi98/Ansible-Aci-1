# Customer YAML file which decsribes all the object that will be deployed by the ansible playbooks.
# To add new objects please COPY/PASTE the structure given here and change the values on the parameters
# in case some varibale aren't fill out or they are taken out from the given structure anisble playbooks 
# will fail their execution

# The fabric YAML file encapsulates all the configurations to be applied to the ACI Fabric itself, which is used by all the tenants. 
# These configurations are not associated to a specific Tenant so they remain even if Tenants are deleted.

# Use the `state` varible under each top level object to add or remove the object itself during deployment 
# state varible values: 
#   - 'present': creates/verify teh existence of the given object 
#   - 'absent': remove the obejct
# If the `state` variable is 'present' but a value is changed in this file for the particular object, ansible will 
# *update* that object on teh ACI fabic. Be careful to keep a consistent state to avoid ACI misconfiguration where not needed
